# T1A3 Terminal Application Assignment - Jordan Attfield

### Outline
My application idea is an app called 'Date with a Book" that allows customers customers to take a quiz and based on their outcome of the quiz, a book will be selected for them to purchase. Users can add books to their shopping cart, manually select other books and also purchase add-ons.

### Style Guide
My code follows the PEP 8 Python styling guide throughout (Python Enhancement Proposals 2022).

### Features
**Feature 1: Quiz**

The quiz features 3 questions that determine the user's genre preference. A score is tallied and based on the score, the user will be directed to a particular genre. A book is then randomly selected from that genre's catalogue and presented to the user for purchase.

I tried to incorporate multiple Python elements within this feature. The quiz uses OOP to create a Question class and then iterates through the list of questions, also using if/else statements to keep a running count of the score based on the answers. Functions are then used to determine the genre preference depending on the score.

**Feature 2: Random Book Selector**



**Feature 3: Birthday Month**
When users first register for an account, the app will ask for their date of birth. Based on this, the app will track which month we are currently in, and add an additional book in their Book Box on their birthday month as a present.

**Feature 4: Track Purchases**
The app will track previous books the users have been sent, so users can track their reading and purchase history.
