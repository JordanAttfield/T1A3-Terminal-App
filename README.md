# T1A3 Terminal Application Assignment - Jordan Attfield

### Outline
My application idea is a monthly book subscription box. Customers can register and then will be asked to complete a small quiz that determines their reading preferences. Based on their answers on the quiz, a box will be created that will include 2 books. 

They can approve the books in their box (and also add or remove books). This box will then be posted to their address. This process occurs once a month.

Users can also login to their account to keep track of the books they have already purchased.

### Features
**Feature 1: Login/registration page**
This page will essentially determine if the user is new to the app or has already registered their details. If they're new, the app will take them through to the registration page to enter their name, email address, DOB and postal address. The user will then be taken to the welcome page.

If they have previously registered, the application will recognise their login details and take them to the welcome page.

**Feature 2: Quiz**
This will be a short quiz for new users that will determine their reading preferences, and based on their answers, a book box will be created for them. For example, if they demonstrated a preference for historical fiction a historical fiction book will more likely be added to their box.

**Feature 3: Birthday Month**
When users first register for an account, the app will ask for their date of birth. Based on this, the app will track which month we are currently in, and add an additional book in their Book Box on their birthday month as a present.

**Feature 4: Track Purchases**
The app will track previous books the users have been sent, so users can track their reading and purchase history.
